# Centralized Patient Record Database

‭ The Universal Health Data System is a document based NoSQL database which‬
‭ maintains patient health records in one location from many different providers. Using‬
‭ a document based NoSQL database, implemented with MongoDB, best achieves the‬
‭ goal of storing large amounts of health data, where the structure must be flexible due‬
‭ to the individualised nature of patients' conditions, history, and lifestyles.‬
‭ The system helps to streamline historical health data collection of patients coming‬
‭ from a different provider, and give practitioners robust details on a patient in order to‬
‭ better analyse and diagnose any problems at hand.‬
‭ The system also offers end points to approved research labs in order to have a‬
‭ centralised location to analyse large health data sets and provide more robust and‬
‭ accurate results for health issues facing the world today.‬
